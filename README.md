This Application is a result of my 7 months study at Java enterprise developement course in It-Academy.
At the beginig of this course I could only do primitive thing like System.out.println.
I really proud of what I have done woth help of my teacher Artsiom Peravoznikau and support of BSB Bank team.
Application`s purposes:
a. user of Application may send request to specific opened URLs (/signin, /login) and closed URLs(/refresh, /logout). This logic is covered by Auth microservice
b. once User logined he may go to closed URLs to use more specific functions of the Application
c. specific functions devided between 3 other microservices (Company, Employee, Convert)
